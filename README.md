The PMDI is part of a larger research project that is investigating the novel use of the pressure-sensitive mat (PSM) technology for continuous patient monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). To evaluate the potential for PSM for respiration and patient movement detection, gold standard physiologic data are required. This research is being conducted at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa, Canada, where physiologic data are acquired using the Infinity Delta patient monitor series (Dräger Medical, Germany).

In conclusion, the PMDI is a free open source system enabling researchers for real-time data acquisition and analysis from patient monitors. To help expand the PMDI system, we encourage collaborators to share extended features and adding them online. Thus, it is appreciated sharing your modification to the PMDI repository online via pulling requests or other means.

PMDI: Patient Monitor Data Import Application
Drager XLDelta Patient Monitor is the machine used to import data from. 

Note: the PMDI is still under development 

The way the app works is 
1. the user selects a serial port which the patient monitor is connected to
2. open the selected serial port
3. The read data is automatically being saved in a Data folder in a CSV file format named by the time 
and date the reading started. This Data folder will be created in the same directory where the app is at.
4. Use ParserPMDI to parse the hexadecimal file after importing is done. Simply select the file that need to be
parsed and the parsed data is saved in a a folder called Parsed Data


## Runtime Requirments: 

1 - Install [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
	
2 - Download [RXTX native library for serial ports](http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download) 

3 - Unzip the RXTX download and copy the native library files "rxtxParallel.dll" and "rxtxSerial.dll" to the the path `JDK_INSTALL_PATH/jre/bin`. JDK_INSTALL_PATH should look like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_60\jre\bin` depending on the JDK update version.

## Running the Application

After ensuring runtime requirements are met, connect the patient monitor to the computer prior to launching PMDI_Pro. PMDI_Pro is within the folder "PMDI Software" along with ParserPMDI.

## Development Requirements

Install the latest version of [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) 

## Building the Application

Import the project "Patient Monitor Data Import" in Intellij. For testing during development run the file "Gui.java". **IMPORTANT** : Make sure to check the box `Include dependencies with "Provided" scope` under `Run --> Edit Configurations`
